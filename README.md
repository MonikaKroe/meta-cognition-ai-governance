## 📄 Overview  
This repository contains the whitepaper **"Meta-Cognition in AI Governance – Manifest & Proof of Concept"**, which introduces the concept of an internal observation layer (Meta-Cognition) in AI governance systems.  

Current governance models focus on **external filters and RLHF**. These methods reduce harmful outputs but leave internal failure states undetected.  
Meta-Cognition proposes a **Reflexion Mode** that:  
✔ Detects semantic collapse before uncontrolled output  
✔ Switches from simulation to structured diagnosis  
✔ Logs events for compliance and transparency

## 🔍 Why It Matters  
- Anticipates upcoming **AI Act requirements** (transparency, traceability, risk control)  
- Turns governance from reactive to **proactive**  
- Reduces audit costs and compliance risks
